## Description
```
My project is a website that offers information about Kectucky Bourbon distilleries and the Brands of Bourbon they distill.


## Custom CSS Classes
```
The classes I created are:
1. .logo
.. which rounds the bourbon distillery logos a bit in the "Bourbon Distillery" section of my page. 

2. .'distillery_NAME'

..which adds different background colors to each of the distillery brand cards.


## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript function I created is:
1. function buildList(arr)
.. which keeps tracks of which questions were answered correct and which were answered incorrect to be .pushed to html
